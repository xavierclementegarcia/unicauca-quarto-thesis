  abstract = {Objectives. This study analyzed whether inadequate functional health literacy is an independent risk factor for hospital admission. Methods. We studied a prospective cohort of 3260 Medicare managed care enrollees. Results. Of the participants, 29.5\% were hospitalized. The crude relative risk (RR) of hospitalization was higher for individuals with inadequate literacy (n = 800; RR = 1.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24, 1.65) and marginal literacy (n = 366; RR = 1.33; 95\% CI = 1.09, 1.61) than for those with adequate literacy (n = 2094). In multivariate analysis, the adjusted relative risk of hospital admission was 1.29 (95\% CI = 1.07, 1.55) for individuals with inadequate literacy and 1.21 (95\% CI = 0.97, 1.50) for those with marginal literacy. Conclusions. Inadequate literacy was an independent risk factor for hospital admission among elderly managed care enrollees. (Am J Public Health. 2002;92:1278--1283)},
